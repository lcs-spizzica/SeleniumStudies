# 🧪 Selenium with Java – Study Progress

This repository tracks my learning journey through the **"Java Testing with Selenium"** course by **freeCodeCamp**, using Selenium WebDriver with Java.

I am currently learning how to work with **radio buttons** in web forms.

## 📌 Current Status

I’m watching and practicing the section of the course that covers:

- Selecting and interacting with **radio buttons** using Selenium
- Checking if a radio button is **selected** (`isSelected()`)
- Best practices for handling dynamic form elements
